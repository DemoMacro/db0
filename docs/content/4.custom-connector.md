# Custom Connector

If there is no built-in connector yet for a SQL database integration, you can create a custom one by yourself.

Explore [built-in connectors](https://github.com/unjs/sql0/tree/main/src/conectors) to learn how to implement a custom connector.

Always feel free to open an issue to [request new connector](https://github.com/unjs/sql0/issues/new?assignees=&labels=connector&projects=&template=feature-request.yml).
